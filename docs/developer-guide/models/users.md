# User Model Documentation

## Overview
The User model is a fundamental part of the application, representing the core attributes and relationships of a user in the system. It is used across various domains and services to manage user-related data and operations.

## Fields
The User model typically includes the following fields:

- **id**: A unique identifier for the user (usually an integer or UUID).
- **username**: A unique string representing the user's login name.
- **email**: The user's email address, used for communication and authentication.
- **password_hash**: A hashed representation of the user's password for secure storage.
- **created_at**: A timestamp indicating when the user was created.
- **updated_at**: A timestamp indicating the last time the user's information was updated.
- **is_active**: A boolean flag indicating whether the user account is active.
- **is_admin**: A boolean flag indicating whether the user has administrative privileges.

## Relationships
The User model may have relationships with other models, such as:

- **Roles**: A many-to-many relationship defining the roles assigned to the user.
- **Posts**: A one-to-many relationship representing the posts created by the user.
- **Groups**: A many-to-many relationship for group memberships.

## Example Usage
Below is an example of how the User model might be used in code:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Boolean, DateTime
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
from database import Base

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    username = Column(String, unique=True, index=True, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, unique=True, index=True, nullable=False)
    password_hash = Column(String, nullable=False)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow)
    is_active = Column(Boolean, default=True)
    is_admin = Column(Boolean, default=False)

    roles = relationship("Role", back_populates="users")
    posts = relationship("Post", back_populates="author")
```

## Notes
- Ensure that sensitive information, such as passwords, is always stored securely using hashing algorithms like bcrypt.
- Use proper validation and constraints to maintain data integrity.
- Regularly update and audit the model to ensure it meets the application's evolving requirements.
