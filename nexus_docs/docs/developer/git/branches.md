# Git Branch Naming Guidelines

## Branch Naming Expectations
To keep our Git history clean and easy to follow, use the following naming conventions for branches:

### Branch Types
- **feature/**: New features
  - `feature/user-authentication`
- **bugfix/**: Fixing a bug
  - `bugfix/login-error`
- **hotfix/**: Emergency fixes for production
  - `hotfix/critical-payment-issue`
- **chore/**: Maintenance tasks that donâ€™t affect app functionality
  - `chore/update-dependencies`
- **docs/**: Documentation updates
  - `docs/api-endpoints`

### General Rules
- Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens).
- Be descriptive but concise.
- Avoid using ticket numbers unless absolutely necessary.

## Why This Matters
Following these conventions helps:
- Keep branch names organized
- Make it easier to identify the purpose of a branch
- Improve collaboration across the team

Clean branches = smooth merges. Stick to the standard.
