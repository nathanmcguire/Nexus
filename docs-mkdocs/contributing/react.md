# :fontawesome-solid-atom: React 

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the React-based frontend application included in the Nexus project. The frontend serves as the user interface for interacting with the Nexus backend services.

| `react/public/`          | Static files such as `index.html` and icons.                              |
| `react/src/`             | Source code for the React application.                                    |
| `react/src/components/`  | Reusable React components.                                                 |
| `react/src/services/`    | API service files for interacting with the backend.                       |
| `react/src/App.js`       | Main application component.                                                |
| `react/src/index.js`     | Entry point for the React application.                                     |
| `react/package.json`     | Node.js dependencies and scripts for the React application.               |

## Key Features
- **React Framework**: Component-based architecture for building user interfaces.
- **API Integration**: Communicates with the FastAPI backend using RESTful APIs.
- **Reusable Components**: Modular and reusable UI components.
- **State Management**: Uses React's built-in state management or external libraries if applicable.

## Development Setup
1. **Requirements**:
   - Node.js (latest LTS version recommended).
   - npm or Yarn package manager.
2. **Steps**:
   - Navigate to the `react/` directory.
   - Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
   - Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`.

## API Integration
The React application communicates with the FastAPI backend using RESTful APIs. Ensure the backend is running and accessible before testing the frontend.

## Testing
- Use `React Testing Library` and `Jest` for writing and running test cases.
- Test files are located in the `react/src/` directory, typically alongside the components being tested.

## Deployment
- Build the application for production: `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
- Deploy the contents of the `build/` directory to a web server or hosting service.

## Contributing
- Follow the project's coding standards and guidelines.
- Submit pull requests for any changes or new features.
